//This section provides useful insights into when to use pointers or values based on performance considerations in Go,
//especially for large data structures. Letâ€™s summarize the key points and provide an example to test these behaviors.
//Key Takeaways
//
//Input Parameters:
//Pointer: Performance is constant (~1 nanosecond), regardless of data size.
//Value: Performance degrades with increasing data size, especially for large structs.
//
//Return Values:
//Small structs (< 1MB): Returning a value is faster than a pointer.
//Large structs (> 1MB): Returning a pointer is faster than a value.
//
//Practical Considerations:
//For most real-world use cases, the difference is negligible unless you're working with extremely large data structures.
//When handling immutable large data, pointers can be an efficient choice.
