//Unconsumed Values: The countTo goroutine is still running and attempts to send the remaining
//values (6 to 9) to the channel ch. However,
//since main has stopped receiving,
//these sends block, causing the countTo goroutine to wait indefinitely.
//
//WaitGroup Deadlock: main then calls wg.Wait(), which waits for the countTo goroutine to finish. But since the
//goroutine is blocked trying to send to ch, it never completes and doesnâ€™t call wg.Done(). This causes a deadlock,
//as main waits indefinitely for the countTo goroutine to finish.
